# This scenario creates a single-instance standalone Neo4j
# machine, that automatically restores from a backup with the given
# parameters in the "initContainers" section.
#
# IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK - you must have pre-created a secret, and 
# you must modify the BUCKET parameter, and make sure backups are in place
# to be restored.   See the documentation for more information.
